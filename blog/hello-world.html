<h2>Hello world.</h2><img class="wave gif" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xUPGcM6Yd1oTFj9e9i/giphy.gif"></img></div>

<p>Hi, This is my first blog here on my personal site. So, as usual, i am starting it with hello world. I have planned to put some technical post here.</p>

<p>I started this site as my pet project. This is a GitHub pages that render ember app.</p>

<p>So what is GitHub page. You can get detailed info <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MsN8gpT6jY">here</a>. Github gives every account with unique URL like (accountname.github.io). You can build your web application using that a repo with name same as your username. That repository will have your site code.</p>

<p>What are the options to code your github page</p>
<p>I know the following options. There may be lot</p>
<ul>
<li>You can just put a simple html file that will have all the content. And to make more sophisticated you can include your own javascript file and css file to that html file.</li>
<li>This is the more Suggested option. <a target="_blank" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyllrb</a>. It is bundle of option to help you to build your site. You can spend more time on your content then to code</li>
<li>OR, You can use some web client frameworks like ember, angular.</li>
</ul>

<p>I used ember to make this site. Here I think I can give some information that may help people, how to put an ember app into GitHub page. Build the ember application using the command ember build. Now you will have deployable ember application inside the dist folder. Copy all the content inside the dist folder to your master branch of the GitHub page repository.</p>

<p>If you are building your site in ember, It might be helpful to have all your static content inside the public directory of ember app, It would be more convenient to be organized into separate directories under public directory of ember application</p>

<p>Now your site will render in your GitHub page URL, You can map your GitHub page URL to your own domain name if you have one. My GitHub page URL is <a target="_blank" href="https://datasweeper.github.io/">https://datasweeper.github.io</a> But i have mapped this URL to my domain name that i have purchased in godaddy.com <a target="_blank" href="http://datasweeper.org">http://datasweeper.org</a>

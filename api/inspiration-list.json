  "text" : "<p>Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly, and get on with improving your other innovations.</p><br><p>Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.</p><br> <p>Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn't matter to me. Going to bed at night saying we've done something wonderful, that's what matters to me.</p><br><p>Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren't used to an environment where excellence is expected.</p><br><p>Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.</p><br><p>Sometimes life is going to hit you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.</p><br><p>It's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them.</p><br><p>Things don't have to change the world to be important.</p><br><p>It's better to be a pirate than to join the Navy.</p><br><p>I'm convinced that about half of what separates the successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance.</p><br>"
